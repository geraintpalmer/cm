***Due date: End of Week 7.***

# Brief

+ Choose a procedure, algorithm or model from the domain of mathematics, operational research or statistics. (There are some ideas below, please discuss your idea with a tutor before beginning the work).
+ Implement this in Python, writing it as a class or a function as appropriate.
+ Use this implementation to solve an appropriate problem or to perform some appropriate experiment.
+ Write a two page report on your work.

# Further Details

+ You will submit ***three pages***: 2 pages of written report *including references and any figures and tables;* and one page of code.
+ Any report exceeding 2 pages will incur a penalty, and only the first two pages will be marked.
+ You are also to submit one page of code. Of course, the code you write in order to solve the problem or perform the experiments, including producing any figures, may exceed one page. Therefore *only include the most appropriate code*, this must include the function or class used to implement the chosen procedure, algorithm or model.
+ You are free to use whatever report structure you wish. One recommended structure would be the following section titles:
  + The Problem
  + Solution Method
  + Code Use & Discussion

# Example

Here is an example of the three pages to be submitted.
The chosen topic was the Mann-Whitney U test.

# Topic Ideas

+ [Numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration)
+ [Stable roommates problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_roommates_problem)
+ [Genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
+ [$$\chi^2$$-test of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test)

# How it will be marked

+ THE CODE (40%)
  + **Correctness (10%)** The code is actually doing what you think it's doing.
  + **Appropriateness (10%)** What you think the code is doing is what it needs to be doing.
  + **Clarity & Readability (10%)** I know what the code is actually doing.
  + **Organisation (10%)** I know what you want you want the code to do.

+ THE REPORT (40%)
  + **Organisation & Clarity (10%)** You have made it easy for me to understood your work.
  + **Comprehension & Understanding (10%)** You have demonstrated that you understand the topic and your work well.
  + **Originality (10%)** You have strived to find an original topic, problem, or performed original experimentation.
  + **Sources (10%)** Appropriate referencing and attribution of information and data.

+ OVERALL (20%)
  + *Reserved for any other business: penalties, exceptional work, my overall opinion of the work, how it all fits together, and so on.*
